                <p>
                    Long Island's most family-owned restaurant since 1998. At Bob's Burgers, we only use the freshest
                    ingredients... and we grind our meat right here! Come see us, we'll give you the best burger you've
                    ever had. Located next to the historic "It's Your Funeral Home and Crematorium" (note: burgers do
                    NOT contain human meat).
                </p>

                    "Our food is great, our staff's full of surprises, so come on down to Bob's for some burgers and
                    some fries-es!"
